/**
 * Safeguard: the Compass curriculum engine must live ONLY under the guarded
 * `/compass` namespace (requireAuth + requireProduct('compass') +
 * loadActorContext applied once, above every mounted module).
 *
 * What this catches: if a curriculum router were mounted ungated at the API root
 * (the old failure mode, where a new path prefix could be left wide open), an
 * anonymous GET would reach the handler and return a 2xx/5xx instead of being
 * rejected. Every curriculum path must instead be rejected before any handler
 * runs: anonymous callers get 401, never a served response. At the root that 401
 * comes from the global `requireAuth` catch-all; under `/compass` it comes from
 * the engine gate.
 *
 * These assertions are intentionally DB-independent: rejected requests never
 * touch the session store or Postgres, so the test runs without a live database.
 * The full per-product / cross-org authorization matrix (other-product -> 403,
 * cross-org -> 404, admin -> all) is verified separately via the live curl
 * matrix in the seed/verify step.
