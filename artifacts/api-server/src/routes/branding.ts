/**
 * Public white-label branding lookup. Resolves branding from the request host
 * ONLY, and the host never authorizes anything: this endpoint returns cosmetic
 * theming (name, accent, tagline, logo) for the matched tenant, or a neutral
 * unbranded response when the host matches no configured organization domain.
 *
 * We read the raw Host header rather than req.hostname (which trusts the proxy's
 * X-Forwarded-Host) so a client cannot spoof another tenant's branding.
 *
 * Branding is also entitlement-gated at read time: white-label branding is only
 * ever served through a custom-domain host match, so the host mapping itself is
 * the customDomain entitlement and the cosmetic fields are the whiteLabel
 * entitlement. When an org downgrades below the entitling tier we suppress its
 * branding (return the neutral default) instead of clearing its stored config,
 * so re-upgrading restores it. We never 402 or otherwise reveal a
 * matched-but-unentitled host: this stays a cosmetic endpoint that never
 * authorizes and never becomes a domain/tier oracle. customDomain implies
 * whiteLabel in the current tier model; both are checked so a future tier
 * reshuffle cannot accidentally leak white-label fields.
